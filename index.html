      <h3>Welcome</h3>

<p>
  <strong>The Open Source Health Tech Foundation (OSHealth)</strong> is a grass-roots organization founded by technologists with the purpose of supporting the vision of the development of a new generation of affordable, reusable, and scalable health care technology that enable current and coming generations to live better lives.
</p>

<h3>Values and raison d'Ãªtre</h3>

<p>
  We believe that there is great human and societal potential to be unlocked by influencing and enabling health care providers, government agencies, NGOs, and support networks to rapidly design, develop, and deploy health tech solutions; as opposed to taking the route of developing expensive, inflexible, overdesigned, closed-source, walled-garden apps and platforms with a lot of vendor lock-in - all of which we believe stiffles the rate of innovation and adoption that is truly possible.
</p>
<p>
  Software is eating the world, and as technology professionals we understand that we have a unique and privileged insight into the binary magic that underpins much of modern day society, and which many outside our profession do not have.
</p>
<p>
  As technology professionals, we continuously face a choice of how we respond to the knowledge of this privilege, and at OSHealth we choose to invest our resources in unveiling the concepts, technology, processes and risks behind the magic, and turn it into comprehensible and actionable knowledge and tools, that will enable stakeholders outside our profession to engage in informed decision-making processes about if and how to technology-enable their health improvement initiatives.
</p>

<h3>Approach and Activities</h3>
<p>
  Publishing articles and doing presentations on the design, development, and use of technology platforms within health tech.
</p>
<p>
  Facilitating the development of apps, web applications and whole platforms and platform ecosystems.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Domains</h3>

<p>
  We're currently undertaking work within mental health tech for the adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) community and within the rehabilitation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in victims of torture and their relatives.
</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>
  We're actively seeking collaboration with individuals and organizations who share our vision of developing and providing affordable, reusable, and scalable health technology - and the knowledge that goes with it - to accelerate innovation and user adoption within the field.
</p>
<p>
  As a non-profit foundation, we are seeking donations that allow us to efficiently allocate resources to, and compensate people for, the work we and they do. Please consider supporting our work with a donation.

  <em>Please note: If something seems rather unpolished, it's probably caused by the fact that this is our first foundation, and we're taking the agile and iterative route of developing and refining it. ;-)</em>
